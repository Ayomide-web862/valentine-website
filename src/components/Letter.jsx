            On this special day, I want to take a moment to express just how much you mean to me. 
            Ever since the time we met back in 100 level, it has been nothing but a wonderful 
            journey knowing you and growing with you.
          </p>
          <p className="letter-text">
            Looking back at all the moments we've shared... from our very first conversations to our countless 
            calls, strolls after Thursday chapel, ice cream dates, sitting together in chapel, our 
            videos and picture... every little thing we did together are all memories I forever 
            cherish. Even our worse days together are still some of the best moments of my life 
            because they helped me learn more about you and also understand how to love you better. 
            
            Every conversation, every quiet, every laugh moment has been a thread weaving the story of us - a story 
            I treasure more than words can say.
          </p>
          <p className="letter-text">
            I know we've been through lots of ups and downs in our relationship but each time, I make 
            sure I learn from those moments to be able to understand you better and love you better. 
          </p>

          <p className="letter-text">
            I really am so grateful for how far we've come, how we've grown, and the journey ahead 
            of us. I may not always have the right words but my feelings for you are very true. 
            I want to keep making memories with you, keep sharing laughter and quiet moments and 
            keep choosing you every single day because you are not just a part of my life, you 
            are a part of me that I never want to live without. You are my best friend, my 
            confidant, and the love of my life.
          </p>

          <p className="letter-text">
            Thank you for being in my life. Thank you for being you. Thank you for every 
            smile, every word, every small act of love that makes me feel so lucky to have you.
          </p>

          <p className="letter-signature">
            Happy Valentine's Day, my love ❤️ <br/>
            Always yours.
